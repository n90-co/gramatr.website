# CLAUDE.md - GrƒÅmatr Website & Brand Identity

## RUNTIME DIRECTIVE - READ THIS FIRST

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: This step is MANDATORY and MUST be completed before any other work.

**EVERY SESSION START:** Before any other action, agents must:
1. Read all files in `~/.gramatr/core/` (Universal behavioral foundation)
2. Read relevant .md files from `~/.gramatr/templates/` based on project type
3. Read this project's contract and context below for current development state
4. Acknowledge loaded rules in first response

**If any core files cannot be read, STOP and ask user to verify file permissions.**

**Required Response Format:** "‚úÖ Loaded: [core rules], [template rules], [website context]"

**During Session:** Reference other files as needed, don't front-load everything.

## Rule Compliance Reminder
If you find yourself unsure about behavioral guidelines during this session, 
re-read ~/.gramatr/core/ files immediately.
